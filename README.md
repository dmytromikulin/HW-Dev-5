# Fibonacci Numbers in Java

This project contains three implementations of the Fibonacci sequence in Java:

## Implementations

- **Iterative:** Efficient linear approach with O(n) time and O(1) space.
- **Recursive:** Naive recursive implementation with exponential time complexity O(2^n).
- **Dynamic Programming:** Recursive with memoization for O(n) time and space.

## UML Diagrams

See the `uml/` folder for the corresponding diagrams (to be added):
- Activity diagram for iterative version
- Sequence diagram for recursive version
- Class diagram for dynamic programming version
